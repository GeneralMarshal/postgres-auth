# Lesson 02: Password Security

**Goal**: Implement secure password handling step-by-step

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- ✅ Understand why we never store plaintext passwords
- ✅ Understand how bcrypt works (salting, hashing, rounds)
- ✅ Implement password hashing
- ✅ Build user registration endpoint
- ✅ Build user login endpoint
- ✅ Validate passwords securely

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Completed Lesson 01
- ✅ Docker containers running (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ NestJS project set up
- ✅ User entity created

## Lesson Structure

This lesson is broken into 4 steps:

1. **STEP-01-password-concepts.md** - Understand password security concepts
2. **STEP-02-bcrypt-setup.md** - Install and configure bcrypt
3. **STEP-03-registration.md** - Build registration endpoint
4. **STEP-04-login.md** - Build login endpoint

## Getting Started

1. Start with **STEP-01-password-concepts.md**
2. Follow each step in order
3. Build along with the code examples
4. Test everything as you go

## Time Estimate

- **STEP 01**: 20 minutes (reading concepts)
- **STEP 02**: 15 minutes
- **STEP 03**: 30 minutes
- **STEP 04**: 25 minutes

**Total**: ~90 minutes

## Key Concepts

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Salting and rounds
- DTO validation
- Security best practices

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, you'll move to **Lesson 03: JWT Tokens Deep Dive** where you'll learn how to create and validate JWT tokens.
