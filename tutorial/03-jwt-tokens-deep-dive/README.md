# Lesson 03: JWT Tokens Deep Dive

**Goal**: Understand JWT structure, creation, validation, and when to use them

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- ✅ Understand JWT structure (header.payload.signature)
- ✅ Understand why we use JWT tokens
- ✅ Create and sign JWT tokens
- ✅ Validate JWT tokens
- ✅ Understand JWT claims (sub, iat, exp)
- ✅ Implement token expiration
- ✅ Integrate JWT with login endpoint

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Completed Lesson 02
- ✅ User registration and login working
- ✅ Password hashing implemented
- ✅ NestJS project configured

## Lesson Structure

This lesson is broken into 4 steps:

1. **STEP-01-jwt-concepts.md** - Understand JWT structure and concepts
2. **STEP-02-jwt-setup.md** - Install and configure JWT module
3. **STEP-03-jwt-service.md** - Create JWT service for token generation
4. **STEP-04-jwt-integration.md** - Integrate JWT with login endpoint

## Getting Started

1. Start with **STEP-01-jwt-concepts.md**
2. Follow each step in order
3. Build along with the code examples
4. Test everything as you go

## Time Estimate

- **STEP 01**: 25 minutes (reading concepts)
- **STEP 02**: 20 minutes
- **STEP 03**: 30 minutes
- **STEP 04**: 25 minutes

**Total**: ~100 minutes

## Key Concepts

- JWT structure (header, payload, signature)
- Token signing and verification
- JWT claims and expiration
- Stateless authentication
- Security considerations

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, you'll move to **Lesson 04: Session Management** where you'll learn about Redis sessions and why JWT alone isn't enough for production.
